**Matthew "Lorimor" Lorimor**

My name is Matthew Lorimor, but I often end up being called "Lorimor" due to the overwhelming amount of Matts on teams I've been a part of. I started as a software developer out of college, eventually pivoted into information security, and have been doing that ever since. I have broad exposure to the entire discipline, but tend to concentrate on cloud platform security and SDLC concerns. I also enjoy incident response activities as I tend to thrive in chaos mode. I have helped design everything from small processes to compliance efforts around specific FedRAMP controls. I know a thing or two about building and shipping software often and securely in ways that don't slow down development.
